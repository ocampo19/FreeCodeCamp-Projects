                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">Lionel Messi</a>, also known as "Leo," was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. His parents are Jorge and Celia Messi. They were not wealthy, but they worked hard to raise Lionel and his three siblings. As a kid Leo loved playing futbol and often played with his 2 older brothers and their friends. At the age of 8 Leo was spotted kicking a ball around by his older brother's coach Carlos Marconi. Marconi liked what he saw and invited Leo to join his brother in Newell's Old Boys futbol club. There, despite being a lot smaller than the other boys, Leo would dribble past all the defenders and score many goals. It wasn't until he was 11 years old that his parents noticed he was much smaller than the boys his age. It was then that he was diagnosed by doctors with growth hormone deficiency (GHD), a condition that restricted his growth. The medical treatment was too expensive for his family to afford.</p>

                    <p>Futbol Club Barcelona's scout, Josep Maria Minguella saw a video of the 12 year old Lionel playing futbol and right away wanted to sign him. Minguella, along with technical director Charly Rexach, flew to Argentina to meet the young, talented boy. Barcelona agreed to pay for Leo's medical treatment if he signed with Barcelona, so the Messi family packed their bags and moved to Barcelona, Spain. Leo's contract was signed on a paper napkin!</p>

                    <p>Leo entered Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, when he was 13. He trained with other talented youths such as Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué. Leo came up through the ranks rapidly starting from the youth academy, then Cadete, Juvenil A, Juvenil B, Barcelona C, Barcelona B, and then the first team. At the age of 16 Lionel Messi made his professional debute on October 16, 2004 when he was subbed in for Decco at the 82<sup>nd</sup> minute. His first professional goal came soon after during stoppage time with an assist from the world's best player at the time, and Leo's good friend, Ronaldinho. From there Messi went on to break and set many records.</p>
